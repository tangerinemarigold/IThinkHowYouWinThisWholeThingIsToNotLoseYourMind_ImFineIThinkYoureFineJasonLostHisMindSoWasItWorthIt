dont worry about me -- some very interesting new projects at work today/this week. very busy but it's fun and fulfilling. we have a huge like extremely huge wgs/rna seq project that im on. ive never seen so much data

whats the story behind chordjs, what were you doing at May 17, 2017 @ 9:44pm at night!! Where were you, what were you doing lol
so you're telling me i had 6 years to learn javascript and i still havent!!! that's how much ill never touch javascript, not even with a stick. someone at rutgers use to say its the fastest language for bioinformatics and im like no thanks


ohh i just read this and i think i sound kind of mean about javascript :( you know some things are better on the phone. call me back, i can make you laugh lol and tell you so much i cant share yet


did you know that my coworker use to look right at jason and purposely call it a 'jason file' even though it's pronounced JSON (jay-son) file. LOL we thought he was a complete dork when we were there, i have no idea why anyone took him seriously. there was this other time my coworker said the screen resolution on the idea factory monitors was really low and he sat there and didn't respond at all. he just took it all in. i literally thought he was a psychopath after that. dude is whacked out on poo brain.


jason had this look that i saw a couple of times that he would give to paul, the "im going to murder you if you keep talking to me" look. paul is pretty expendable to jason, always was.


im bored :(

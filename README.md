fuzzy lumpkins lost his mind lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIP3wZwWJA4

literally whacked out on poo brain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emVUkzjykro


dont worry about me -- some very interesting new projects at work today/this week. very busy but it's fun and fulfilling. we have a huge like extremely huge wgs/rna seq project that im on. ive never seen so much data

whats the story behind chordjs, what were you doing at May 17, 2017 @ 9:44pm at night!! Where were you, what were you doing lol
so you're telling me i had 6 years to learn javascript and i still havent!!! that's how much ill never touch javascript, not even with a stick. someone at rutgers use to say its the fastest language for bioinformatics and im like no thanks


ohh i just read this and i think i sound kind of mean about javascript :( you know some things are better on the phone. call me back, i can make you laugh lol and tell you so much i cant share yet


did you know that my coworker use to look right at jason and purposely call it a 'jason file' even though it's pronounced JSON (jay-son) file. LOL we thought he was a complete dork when we were there, i have no idea why anyone took him seriously. there was this other time my coworker said the screen resolution on the idea factory monitors was really low and he sat there and didn't respond at all. he just took it all in. i literally thought he was a psychopath after that. dude is whacked out on poo brain.


jason had this look that i saw a couple of times that he would give to paul, the "im going to murder you if you keep talking to me" look. paul is pretty expendable to jason, always was.


im bored sensiz :(((


i forgot to mention, we are going to istanbul this summer, most likely bc my dads friends son is getting married there (theyre canadian). i have no idea if im going to see you by then, but ive never been there before so it will be interesting. i just want food and maybe hookah lol and that dress is what i want to wear (maybe) but they marked up the price which is so shiesty, theres no way theyre going to change the price bc i tweeted at them, i might have to spend the extra $40!!! i am livid, in broad daylight they are price gouging >:| i want it in black and the one in red, so thats an extra $80, im so annoyed. i dont think i will know enough turkish to converse with people but itll be interesting to see what i know. i am watching some old movie and then i have to login to work tomorrow morning for this project i cant talk about that's just sooooo huge, TBs of data and then i have to teach my team how the CLI for basespace works etc. work is just challenging enough where i can forget the whole elephant in the room, i impress myself with how much i can work through it. its like weird, once i am focused on something, i can forget about everything else, so thats good. i use to be able to do this at rutgers too, "forget everything, just focus on the most important thing in front of me" etc. i really want to learn more aws but i need to find the time to learn it ugh

do you how many weddings ive been to in the past 6 years, a lot, it's always someone elses btw >:|

it's difficult for me to watch a movie or anything, because this whole thing is so interesting everything else pales in comparison. even to some of the best literature, to which i find myself saying, "been there, done that". this whole thing is a little bit of everything all at the same time, which makes sense because i threw almost everything i had at it.

btw if yo ass keeps picking up chicks on interviews and you cheat on me, im soooo done with you. >:|

not trying to be mean with the prenup, its the most responsible thing to do, BUT i do have a little bit of an inheritance from my parents and they want it to be used for something good like a house etc./charity, bc its from my grandparents. just an fyi.
